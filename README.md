# Python.Vii
Python based Vim clone

# Goal

A fully compatible clone of Vim written in Python, that is configurable and
extensible both in VimScript and in Python.

# Roadmap

1. Getting usable
2. Getting compatible
3. Enter the future

# Reasoning

Vim is a great editor, but VimScript is difficult. This lowers the acceptance
of Vim and slows down it's evolution.

By migrating Vim to a beatiful and widely used programming language, I try
to bring the editor to a new starting position. I hope to get two communities
into the boat, convinced Vim users as well as a lot of Python developers.
The PEP processess may serve as a role model how the future evolution can be
organized.

There are other projects with the goal to write a better editor than Vim. I
think an editor should first catch up with Vim before it can outrun. Without
full Vim compatibility the habitual users will not join the company.

# Progress

I am getting close to a minimal Editor with one Window. Moving, editing,
copying and delting already work in a reasonable way.

The commandline to read and write files is still missing. Once that is
working, the first version will be published.
